# Message-In-A-Bottle
HTML code, embbeded in JavaScript, for an educative soundboard implemented into Canvas LMS. 

To fix compatibility issues, the bottle images were uploaded into imgur (https://imgur.com/) and the audios were uploaded into Internet Archive (https://archive.org/).
Then, their absolute paths were copied into the scripts provided.
Soundboard_MIAB49.html links the audios to the images, allowing one to play and/or pause each recording on click. Scroll_pictures10.html links the images to a transcript of the audio, which appears while the cursor hovers over the bottle pictures.

Please acknowledge Dr Marina Klemm and Dr Kathryn Jones from The University of Auckland, Aotearoa New Zealand, if these scripts are implemented into your teaching platform. 
For questions, contact Marina through marinaklemm@gmail.com
