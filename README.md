# Message-In-A-Bottle
HTML code, embbeded in JavaScript, for an educative soundboard implemented into Canvas LMS. 

To fix compatibility issues, the bottle images were uploaded into imgur (https://imgur.com/) and the audios were uploaded into Internet Archive (https://archive.org/).
Then, their absolute paths were copied into the scripts provided.
Soundboard_MIAB49.html corresponds to the audios linked into the images, and Scroll_pictures10.html allows you to see a transcript of the audio while hovering the bottle pictures.
