# Message-In-A-Bottle
HTML code for an educative soundboard implemented into Canvas LMS. 

For compatibility problems, the bottle images were uploaded into imgur (https://imgur.com/) and the audios were uploaded into Interner Archive (https://archive.org/).
Then, their absolute paths were copied into the scripts provided.
The first script corresponds to the audios linked into the images, and the other one allows you to see a transcript of the audio while hovering the bottle pictures.
